# Spark Exercise with Scala

Keywords: *MapReduce*, *Spark*, *Scala*, *market basket analysis*, *social network analysis*

This is my work on Spark using Scala. This is actually the first-time I learned and used Scala :).

## Group Average Calculation
This is a beginner one, helping to familiarize with Scala and Spark.
The essence of this exercise is to calculate the average of values by groups using simple Map and Reduce.

## Market Basket Analysis
This is an exercise of market basket analysis. I implemented Savasere, Omiecinski and Navathe (SON) Algorithm and A-priori Algorithm to find out frequent itemsets in market baskets.

## Graph Community Detection
In this example, I implemented the Girvan-Newman algorithm using the Spark Framework in order to detect communities in the movie raters graph. I created two classes - Betweenness to calculate the overall betweenness of the graph; and Community to calculate the modularity of the graph and detect communities.
