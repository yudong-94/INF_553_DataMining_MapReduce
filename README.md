# INF 553 DataMining (MapReduce Using Scala)

This is the assignment archive for INF 553 Foundations and Applications of Data Mining. This course mainly teaches MapReduce fundations and its application in data mining, market basket analysis, recommendation system, etc. The assignments could either be done in Python or Scala. Here I used Scala (first-time learning and using it :)).
