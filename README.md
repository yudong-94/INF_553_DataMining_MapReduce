Keywords: *MapReduce*, *Spark*, *Scala*, *market basket analysis*, *recommender system*

This is the assignment archive for INF 553 Foundations and Applications of Data Mining. This course mainly teaches MapReduce fundations and its application in data mining, market basket analysis, recommendation system, etc. The assignments could either be done in Python or Scala. Here I used Scala (first-time learning and using it :)).

## Assignment 1
Assignment 1 is a beginner one, helping to familiarize with Scala and Spark.
The essence of this homework is to calculate the average of values by groups using simple Map and Reduce.

## Assignment 2
Assignment 2 is an example of market basket analysis. It is to implement Savasere, Omiecinski and Navathe (SON) Algorithm and A-priori Algorithm to find out frequent itemsets in market baskets.

## Assignment 3
Assignment 2 is to build a recommender system of movies. It includes two tasks: Task 1 is to build a model-based recommender system using the collabrative filtering library in mllib in spark; Task 2 is to build a user-based collaborative filtering or item-based collaborative filtering system without using any external library.
