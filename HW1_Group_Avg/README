Instruction on Running the Jar files

In this assignment, my Scala version is 2.11.8, and my Spark version is 1.6.1. Besides, I used the sbt structure and plugin to generate the Jar files.

Please use the spark-submit command to run the Jar file. I didn’t include the three data files in the zip file, so please use your local files and change the paths below accordingly. Thanks a lot!

Command for Task 1:
yourname$ ./bin/spark-submit --class avgRating --master local[1] Yu_Dong_task1.jar “yourLocalPathTo/ratings.dat" "yourLocalPathTo/users.dat"

Output:
This command will generate a folder named “movieAvgRating” in your local work directory. Inside this folder, there is a “part-00000” text file. This is exactly the output text file requested for this task.

Command for Task 2:
yourname$ ./bin/spark-submit --class avgRating2 --master local[1] Yu_Dong_task2.jar “yourLocalPathTo/ratings.dat" "yourLocalPathTo/users.dat" "yourLocalPathTo/movies.dat"

Output:
This command will generate a folder named “genreAvgRating” in your local work directory. Inside this folder, there is a “part-00000” text file. This is exactly the output text file requested for this task.
